Brainstorm:
For my Final game I think I want to take this game and limit the amount the player can shoot. 
What I am thinking is every time the player shoots a bullet they get knocked back a little, and if they go all the way off then they lose health. 
This takes some of shoot out of the shootemup but I think makes it mroe engaging as well as more interesting because of the meaningful choice that is created. 
this idea came from Jared and I riffing, about schmups. I was tlaking about the game I made this summer where you only had one bullet and if that could be a Schmup. 
The answer was prolly not, but having some kind of negative feedback loop for when a player shoots in a Schmup I find interesting. 
Also this will keep the player from being able to camp the bottom of the screen as that is the meta for this current build. 




Prototype 1: 
For prototype one all I have really done so far was make it through msot of chapter 31. I think a lot of this is going to be
really good for my game going forward, but I haven't worked on my tweak yet very much. I want the base game to be complete and 
then to put my twist on it. So I have player tested a couple of times with my roommates/friends and they seem to like it, but 
it isn't really remixed yet, and that is what I will have done for next week with some mroe player testing implemented as well.
